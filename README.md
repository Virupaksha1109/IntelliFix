# IntelliFix

🚀 IntelliFix:
IntelliFix: AI-Driven Repository-Level Bug Detection, Classification, Duplicate Identification & Automated Repair

🔍 Overview:
IntelliFix is an AI-powered software analysis platform that automatically scans entire code repositories to detect bugs, classify their types, identify duplicate issues, and generate explainable automated fixes.
Unlike existing tools that only detect issues or provide editor-level suggestions, IntelliFix delivers an end-to-end intelligent bug management and repair pipeline.

🎯 Problem Statement:
Software teams spend a significant portion of development time manually identifying, triaging, and fixing bugs across large repositories. Existing solutions focus either on static analysis or AI-based code suggestions but lack repository-level automation, duplicate bug detection, and fix explainability in a single unified system.

✅ Solution:
IntelliFix addresses this gap by combining static analysis, machine learning, semantic similarity, and AI-driven code repair into a single platform that operates at the repository level.

✨ Key Features:
🔎 Repository-Level Bug Detection – Scans entire codebases, not just single files

🧠 Bug Classification – Automatically classifies bugs into syntax, runtime, and logical errors

🔁 Duplicate Bug Detection – Identifies and clusters semantically similar bugs

📊 Custom Bug–Fix Dataset Creation – Builds a dataset from real-world open-source repositories

🤖 AI-Based Fix Generation – Generates intelligent code repair suggestions

🧩 Explainable Fixes – Provides line-by-line explanations for every suggested fix

🌐 Web Dashboard – Visualizes bugs, fixes, metrics, and analysis results


🧠 System Workflow (High Level):
1)Repository ingestion

2)Static bug detection

3)Bug classification using ML

4)Duplicate bug identification using embeddings

5)Bug–fix retrieval from dataset

6)AI-based fix generation and ranking

7)Explainable output via dashboard

📌 Why IntelliFix Is Different

IntelliFix is not just a bug detector — it is an intelligent, explainable, and automated bug repair system operating at repository scale.
